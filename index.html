<h5>Lyrics</h5>
<pre style="color:tomato;">
    What would I do without your smart mouth?
    Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
    You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
    What's going on in that beautiful mind?
    I'm on your magical mystery ride
    And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

    My head's under water
    But I'm breathing fine
    You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

    'Cause all of me
    Loves all of you
    Love your curves and all your edges
    All your perfect imperfections
    Give your all to me
    I'll give my all to you
    You're my end and my beginning
    Even when I lose, I'm winning
    'Cause I give you all of me
    And you give me all of you, oh-oh

    How many times do I have to tell you?
    Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
    The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
    You're my downfall, you're my muse
    My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
    I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

    My head's under water
    But I'm breathing fine
    You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

    'Cause all of me
    Loves all of you
    Love your curves and all your edges
    All your perfect imperfections
    Give your all to me
    I'll give my all to you
    You're my end and my beginning
    Even when I lose, I'm winning
    'Cause I give you all of me
    And you give me all of you, oh-oh
    Give me all of you, oh

    Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
    Risking it all, though it's hard
    'Cause all of me

    Loves all of you
    Love your curves and all your edges
    All your perfect imperfections
    Give your all to me
    I'll give my all to you
    You're my end and my beginning
    Even when I lose, I'm winning
    'Cause I give you all of me
    And you give me all of you
    I give you all of me
    And you give me all of you, oh-oh</pre>
